# DiAuto 0.3.12 — 2026-10-01

- The instrument cluster mirror can now be limited to when you want it: always, only while a map is on screen (cruising or navigating), or only while a route is being guided. Defaults to always, which is the previous behaviour.
- The mirror follows Android Auto's navigation channel to tell those states apart; when it is withheld, the stock cluster display gets its layer back instead of showing a frozen frame.

# DiAuto 0.3.11 — 2026-10-01

- Mirror the Android Auto picture onto the vehicle instrument cluster display on firmware whose cluster area is shared with apps. Off by default; turn it on and reconnect. No BYD private permission is used.
- Complete Simplified and Traditional Chinese coverage: the Wi-Fi Direct, Nearby and local-hotspot notices are now translated, and Traditional Chinese no longer drops to English across the setup wizard, diagnostics and audio settings.
- A car set to a language DiAuto has no translation for now starts in Simplified Chinese instead of English. Picking a language, or System default, still wins.

# DiAuto 0.3.10 — 2026-09-29

- Completed English, Simplified Chinese, Arabic, Russian and Spanish coverage, including home, connection setup, diagnostics and audio settings.
- Arabic right-to-left layout support and Simplified Chinese display/theme options.
- On Android 13+, Android Settings and the in-app language picker now stay synchronized; older Android keeps the saved language choice.
- Language selection survives settings export/import and resets correctly to System default.
- Automatic translation-coverage and format checks help prevent regressions.
- Clarify the BYD-only support scope on the README and all five website editions.

# DiAuto 0.3.3 — BYD HUD navigation

- Standalone windshield arrows, next-turn distance and street names on verified DiLink5.1 firmware, without ADB, root or a computer helper.
- Add opt-in BYD navigation settings and background vendor output with route-end, disconnect and stale-guidance cleanup. Force-stop cleanup occurs on the next launch.
- Recover the current Wi-Fi Direct interface/BSSID when it appears late; allow a bounded grace period before using a plausible cached fallback. Preserve Static BSSID overrides.
- Add a best-effort Bluetooth auto-start notification fallback and useful recovery diagnostics.
- Thanks to @STUkh for PR #2 and the Wi-Fi recovery/auto-start improvements.

# DiAuto 0.3.1 — first public release

- Native wireless Android Auto on tested BYD DiLink 5.1, plus wired USB.
- New car-friendly home screen, settings pages, controls and dialogs.
- Music-through-car-Bluetooth mode avoids competing media audio focus.
- Wireless groups prefer the car Wi-Fi channel when supported, reducing observed scrolling stalls.
- Bounded SurfaceView frame pacing and preserved full-screen touch alignment.
- No extra phone companion app, root, dongle or firmware changes required.
- 576 unit tests pass; optimized release tested on DiLink 5.1.

Other head units and sustained performance are not guaranteed. The tested display
reports about 58 Hz; the app does not promise constant 60 FPS.
